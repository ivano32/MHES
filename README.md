# MHES

Contains programs that we started with my kid in the US summer of 2023 for him to practice multiplication, and a third program that we extended with additional functionality at the school in November 2023. My kid likes history and military history so they are framed around historical battles.

The src/c folder contains the original programs written in C.
The src/web folder will contain a program written in javascript so it runs on a web browser.

To run the programs on the src/c folder, on a mac or linux:

	Clone the repository (google)
 	Install gcc with your package manager
  	cd /Users/yourname/thelocationwhereyouclone
   	gcc mhes.c -o mhes.out
    	./mhes.out

On windows:
	I don't know. You need gcc the open source compiler for C.

To run the programs on the src/web folder, on any platform:

	Download the HTML file and open it.

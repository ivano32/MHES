# MHES

Contains programs that we started with my kid in the US summer of 2023 for him to practice multiplication, and a third program that we extended with additional functionality at the school in November 2023. My kid likes history and military history so they are framed around historical battles.

The programs are written in C - we welcome a rewrite of the third program to a more amenable language for kids like rust or go or perhaps python, something that does well on terminal applications as these are terminal applications.

To run the programs, on a mac or linux:

  Clone the repository (google)
  Install gcc with your package manager
  cd /Users/yourname/thelocationwhereyouclone
  gcc mhes.c -o mhes.out
  ./mhes.out

On windows:
  I don't know. You need gcc the open source compiler for C.

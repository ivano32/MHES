# MHES

Contains programs that we started with my kid in the US summer of 2023 for him to practice multiplication, and a third program that we extended with additional functionality at the school in November 2023.

The programs are written in C - we welcome a rewrite of the third program to a more amenable language for kids like rust or go or perhaps python, something that does well on terminal applications as these are terminal applications.
